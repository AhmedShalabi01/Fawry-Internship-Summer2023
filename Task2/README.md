# Online Shop Application
Develop a simplified online shop system where users can add products to a shopping cart, view the total cost, and place an order. The application would contain the following classes.
1. Product: A class to represent individual products. Each product has a name and a price.
2. ShoppingCart: Aclass to manage the shopping cart functionality.
3. OrderProcessor: Aclass to handle order processing.
4. Main: we create some sample products, create a shopping cart, add products to the cart, and then display the total cost. Finally, we create an instance of OrderProcessor and use it to place the order, which will print the order details.
